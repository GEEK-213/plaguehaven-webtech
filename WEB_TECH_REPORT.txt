Title: Design and Development of a Website Using HTML & JavaScript

1. Introduction
This project represents a comprehensive implementation of modern web development techniques using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website serves as a showcase of skills acquired through the "Web Development for Beginners" course on Udemy, demonstrating proficiency in front-end development and responsive design. The site features five core pages:

- Home Page: The landing page features a hero section with a call-to-action button, navigation menu, and featured content section. Implemented using semantic HTML5 elements like <header>, <main>, and <section> tags.

- About Page: Contains detailed information about the website's purpose and developer background. Utilizes CSS Grid for layout and includes an interactive timeline component built with JavaScript.

- Store Page: Showcases products with dynamic filtering and sorting capabilities. Each product card includes hover effects and a modal window for detailed information.

- Contact Page: Features a responsive form with real-time validation using JavaScript. Includes fields for name, email, and message with proper input constraints.

- News Page: Displays articles in a card layout with pagination functionality. Implemented using JavaScript for dynamic content loading.

Each page was designed with mobile-first approach, ensuring optimal viewing experience across all devices. Accessibility features include ARIA labels, proper heading hierarchy, and keyboard navigation support.
